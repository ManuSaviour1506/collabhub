# 🎓 CollabHub - The AI-Powered Peer Learning Platform


## 🚀 Overview

**CollabHub** is a next-generation skill exchange platform designed to democratize education. It connects students who want to learn a skill with peers who can teach it, fostering a community of mutual growth.

Unlike traditional platforms, CollabHub integrates **AI mentorship**, **gamification**, and **real-time collaboration tools** (whiteboards, chat) to make peer learning engaging, credible, and effective.

## 💡 The Problem
Students often struggle to find reliable mentors or study partners. Traditional tutoring is expensive, and self-learning lacks structure and feedback. Furthermore, students have no way to verify or showcase their "soft skills" like teaching and collaboration to future employers.

## ✅ The Solution
CollabHub solves this by creating a **skills marketplace**:
1.  **Smart Matching:** Connects "Skills Wanted" with "Skills Known".
2.  **Credibility System:** Users earn XP, Levels, and Badges for teaching, building a verified "Proof of Work" portfolio.
3.  **AI Support:** An integrated Gemini AI Tutor fills the gaps when mentors aren't available.
